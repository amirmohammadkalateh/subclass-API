## Subclass API for ANN (Artificial Neural Network)

This section defines the standard structure and expected functionality for a subclass API designed for building Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs).  This API promotes modularity, flexibility, and ease of use in defining and training various ANN architectures.

**Core Principles:**

* **Inheritance:**  All custom ANN architectures should inherit from a base `ANN` class (or similar abstract base class if applicable in your framework).  This ensures a consistent interface and allows for shared functionality.
* **Layer-based Construction:**  The network should be constructed by composing individual layers.  Each layer should be a self-contained module with well-defined input and output.
* **Flexibility:** The API should allow for the easy addition of custom layers, activation functions, and network topologies.
* **Training Integration:**  The subclass API should seamlessly integrate with a training loop, providing methods for forward propagation, backpropagation, and parameter updates.
